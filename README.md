## Southern New Hampshire University Projects

### Distributed Artificial intelligence Simulation
I am currently working on my Capstone Project for my Computer Science Degree from The University Of Southern New Hampshire.  For my project I am creating a web simulation of distributed artificial intelligence for self assembling robots.  
![Distributed Artificial intelligence Simulation][die-simulation]
This project is currently in development but if you want to check out an early version of the project please visit the [project repo](https://github.com/joeross999/Distributed-Intelligence-Experiment)


## Personal Projects

### Snake 
![Snake][Snake]
For this project I attempted to recreate the classic game "Snake" using vanilla javascript.  It was a fun project to test out some of my coding skills using the Model-View-Controller Pattern.  [Check out the code here](https://github.com/joeross999/Snake)

### The Life Of Code
This is my personal website that is currently in development.  I had to put the project on hold during the last few months due to an increase in school work load, and other personal reasons. I hope to continue to improve the site and start to upload content soon.  [Take a look at what I have so far...](http://thelifeofcode.com)

### A collection of my earlier projects
This website has a number of my early projects.  Feel free to explore.

## Udacity Projects
I have completed the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree so these are just a few of the projects that I developed during that program.

### Frogger Web Game
![Frogger Web Game][frogger-sim]
This is a simple frogger clone rendered in the browser using the HTML 5 canvas.  This project was entirely developed as part of the Nanodegree program.

### New Zealand National Parks Weather Project
![New Zealand National Parks Weather Projec][New-Zealand-Weather-Project]
I developed this project on my own for an assignment during the nanodegree.  This project uses the Google Maps API for the map data and APIXU for retrieving weather data for National Parks in New Zealand.  I used the Knockout.ks framework to implement a Model-View-View-model pattern.  The project renders on both desktop and mobile (although this was one of my first mobile responsive sites so the mobile experience isn't perfect). The code is located [here](https://github.com/joeross999/New-Zealand-National-Parks-Weather-Project). [Checkout the project here!](https://spiker.neocities.org/NewZealandWeatherProject/index.html)

I also Completed a Code Review for one of the early steps in the process.  [View the code review](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Dhu-pZ6JPHKndhZWyd7ojdCWxedM57L)

### Udacity Feed Reader Jasmine Testing Exercise
This was a simple project to learn how to use Jasmine.  I am now using Jasmine as the testing framework for [Distributed Artificial intelligence Simulation](#Distributed-Artificial-intelligence-Simulation).  [View the repo](https://github.com/joeross999/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)

### RoboND Rover Project
This was a project that I completed as part of a Udacity robotics class.  It uses python to control a robot to navigate an unknown terrain using a virtual camera as an input device.  [View the Code](https://github.com/joeross999/RoboND-Rover-Project)

## UMass Amherst Projects
Both of these projects were developed during my freshman year at UMass Amherst.

### Binary Search Tree

### Sorting Algorithms
